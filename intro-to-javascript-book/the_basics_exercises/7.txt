7. Will an error occur if you try to access an array element with an 
index that is greater than or equal to the length of the array? For example:


let foo = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
console.log(foo.length);  // => 3
console.log(foo[3]);      // will this result in an error?


ANSWER:
No this will not result in an error. Even though JavaScript is 0-indexed
and the element at the array length index does not exist, JavaScript will not
throw an error. Instead, JavaScript will return undefined for this value.
