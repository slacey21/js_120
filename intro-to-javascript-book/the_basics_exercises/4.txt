4. Explain why this code logs '510' instead of 15.

console.log('5' + 10);

ANSWER:
Because of the use of the + operator with at least one operand being a String,
JavaScript uses implicit type coercion to coerce 10 to the string '10' and then uses
the plus operator (+) to concatenate the two strings '5' and '10' into '510'.
