12. What value does the following expression evaluate to?

'12' < '9'

ANSWER: true

This answer evaluates to true because when comparing two strings not using the === operator
JavaScript performs a character-by-character comparison from left to right. First it compares 1 to 9
and concludes that the LHS is less than the RHS, thus returning true.
