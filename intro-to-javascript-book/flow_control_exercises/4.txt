4. What does the following code log to the console and why?

function barCodeScanner(serial) {
  switch (serial) {
    case '123':
      console.log('Product1');
    case '113':
      console.log('Product2');
    case '142':
      console.log('Product3');
    default:
      console.log('Product not found!');
  }
}

barCodeScanner('113');

ANSWER: 
The code will log:
Product2
Product3
Product not found!

Although the argument passed to the barCodeScanner invocation 
does match the second case, there is no 'break' statement after
console.log('Product2'); which results in fall-through. Thus, the third
and default expressions are also evaluated and 'Product3' and
'Product not found!' are logged to the console.
