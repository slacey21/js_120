let array1 = [2, 6, 4];
let array2 = [2, 6, 4];

console.log(array1 === array2);


ANSWER:
The output will be false. The arrays have the same value but they do not point
to the same space in memory so they cannot be compared with the strict equality operator.
JavaScript checks equality of two objects by checking if they are the same object, not just
that they have the same values.
