6. What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

let a = 5;
let b = false;

if (a > 4) {
  let b = true;
}

console.log(b);


ANSWER: This will log false. The if code block creates a new variable called 'b'
but does not mutate the variable 'b' with global scope. The global 'b' variable is the 
one logged to the console, which will still be false.
