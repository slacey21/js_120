5. What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

function myFunction() {
  let a = 1;

  if (true) {
    console.log(a);
    let a = 2;
    console.log(a);
  }
}

myFunction();


ANSWER: This code will log a ReferenceError because the inner code block knows that
a variable a will be defined but has not yet been defined, so the inner scope a variable 
will not be able to be referenced.
