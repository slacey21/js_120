2. What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.


if (true) {
  let myValue = 20;
}

console.log(myValue);


ANSWER: Thsi will log a ReferenceError because myValue is defined with block scope
and is deleted before being called in the console.log() call.
