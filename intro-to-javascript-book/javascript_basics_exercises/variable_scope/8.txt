8. What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

let a = 1;

function myFunction(a) {
  console.log(a);
}

let b = 2;

myFunction(b);

ANSWER:  This will log 2 to the console. a is a global variable and 
a is also a parameter value for the myFunction function. passing b in as an 
arguument to myFunction will log the value of b.
