10. What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

const a = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe'
};

function myFunction() {
  a.firstName = 'Jane';
}

myFunction();

console.log(a);


ANSWER: This will log 
{ firstName: 'Jane', lastName: 'Doe}. This code works because you can mutate an object
assigned to a const, but cannot reassign the const to a whole new object.
