10. Determine what the following code snippet logs. First solve it 
in your head or on paper, and only then run it in your JavaScript 
console to check the result.

let speed = 0;
let acceleration = 24;
let brakingForce = 19;

let isMoving = brakingForce < acceleration && (speed > 0 || acceleration > 0);

console.log(isMoving);

ANSWER:
true

the isMoving variable evaluates to:
(19 < 24) && (0 > 0 || 24 > 0)
true && (false || true)
true && true
true


Bonus question: Do we need the parentheses in the boolean expression or could we also have written the following?

let isMoving = brakingForce < acceleration && speed > 0 || acceleration > 0;

No, you need the parentheses because && has precedence over || in conditional operations,
 so you would need parentheses to have the expression be evaluated in the desired order.
