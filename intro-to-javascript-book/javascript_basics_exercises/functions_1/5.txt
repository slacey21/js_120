5. Determine the output that the following code will log to the console:


function multiplesOfThree() {
  let divisor = 1;

  for (let dividend = 3; dividend <= 30; dividend += 3) {
    console.log(dividend + ' / ' + divisor + ' = 3');
    divisor += 1;
  }
}

multiplesOfThree;

ANSWER:
There will be no output because multiplesOfThree is not invoked properly.
You would have to write multiplesOfThree() to properly invoke the function.
