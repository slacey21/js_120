7. How many arguments does the Array.prototype.join() method expect? 
What happens if you call it with less or more arguments?

ANSWER:
It expects one argument. If you call it with no arguments, 
the elements are separated with a comma. If provided with more than 
one argument, the extra arguments will be ignored and only the first
argument will be used as the separator.
