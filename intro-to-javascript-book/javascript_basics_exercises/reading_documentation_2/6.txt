6. The MDN page for Date lists two methods to get the year of a date.

let today = new Date();

today.getYear();
today.getFullYear();

What is the difference between the two methods and which one should you use?

the getYear() method returns the current year - 1900 (i.e., today.getYear() returns
123). The getFullYear() returns the current year (i.e., today.getFullYear() returns
2023.) You should use getFullYear() because getYear() is deprecated.
