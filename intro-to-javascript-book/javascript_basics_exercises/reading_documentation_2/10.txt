10. Run the following code.

let tweet = 'Woohoo! :-)';

if (tweet.length() > 140) {
  console.log('Tweet is too long!');
}

You'll see that it raises an error:

TypeError: tweet.length is not a function

Check the documentation of both TypeError and length, in order to find out what causes the error.


ANSWER:
length is a property of Strings (and arrays) and not a method, so the 
length property should be called without ().
