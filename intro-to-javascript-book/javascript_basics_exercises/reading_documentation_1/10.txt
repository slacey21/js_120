10l In your JavaScript console, execute the following two lines 
of code to check whether their return values differ and if so, how. 
Take a look at the MDN documentation on equality comparisons to 
read about how == and === differ.

'8' == 8
'8' === 8

The first will be true
The second will be false

'==' will try to coerce the type of its operands to be the same and then
evaluate whether the values are the same. The '===' requires that the operands
be of the same type and have the same value.
