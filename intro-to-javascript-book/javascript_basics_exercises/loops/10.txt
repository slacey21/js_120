10. What is the difference between the two code snippets?

////////////////
let counter = 0;

while (counter > 0) {
  console.log('Woooot!');
  counter -= 1;
}


////////////////
let counter = 0;

do {
  console.log('Woooot!');
  counter -= 1;
} while (counter > 0);


ANSWER:
The first code snippet checks the condition before doing anything.
The second code snippet performs the action first one time before checking the condition.

In this case the first code snippet will not log anything, and the second
code snippet will log 'Woooot!' once to the console.
