10. Challenging Exercise This exercise has nothing to do with this chapter. 
Instead, it uses concepts you learned earlier in the book. If you can't 
figure out the answer, don't worry: this question can stump developers with 
more experience than you have.

Consider this code:


> let x = "5"
> x = x + 1
= "51"

Now, consider this code:

Copy Code
> let y = "5"
> y++
What gets returned by y++ in the second snippet, and why?

ANSWER:
5. This happens because the post-increment operator returns the value being operated on
first the performs the increment operation. y will have the value "6" after this operation, but
the code will return 5.
