6. Will this program produce an error when run? Why or why not?

const FOO = 'bar';
{
  const FOO = 'qux';
}

console.log(FOO);


ANSWER: No. The "const FOO = 'qux'" inside the block will not reassign a value
to FOO, but will create a new block-level variable named FOO that shadows the 
other FOO. The code will log 'bar' to the console.
