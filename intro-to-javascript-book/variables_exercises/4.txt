// 4. What happens when you run the following code? Why?

const NAME = 'Victor';
console.log('Good Morning, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Evening, ' + NAME);

NAME = 'Joe';
console.log('Good Morning, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Evening, ' + NAME);


ANSWER:
The code will output:
Good Morning, Victor
Good Afternoon, Victor
Good Evening, Victor

and then will return an error when trying to reassign the value 'Joe' to NAME
because NAME is a const and cannot be redefined.
