5. Take a look at this code snippet: What does it log to the console and why?

let foo = 'bar';
{
  let foo = 'qux';
}

console.log(foo);

ANSWER: This will log 'bar' to the console because that is the value given to 
foo at the same scope as the console.log call. The "let foo = 'qux'" call within the 
block will create a new foo at that block level, but the foo accessed outside of that block
still holds the value 'bar'.
