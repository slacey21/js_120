7. Without running the following code, what do you think it will output?

function foo(bar, qux) {
  console.log(bar);
  console.log(qux);
}

foo('Hello');

ANSWER:
'Hello'
undefined

Since a second argument was not given to the foo call and 
there is no default value assigned to qux, the value for qux
is undefined and the the console.log(qux) call 
in the function body will log undefined.
