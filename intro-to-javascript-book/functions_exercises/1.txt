1. What does this code log to the console? 
Does executing the foo function affect the output? Why or why not?

let bar = 1;
function foo() {
  let bar = 2;
}

foo();
console.log(bar);

ANSWER:
This code logs 1 to the console. Executing the foo function does not affect 
the output because foo only defines the bar variable within the scope of the foo()
function. Once console.log(bar); is called, that references the bar variable at the 
global scope.
