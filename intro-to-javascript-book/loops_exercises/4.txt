4. Does the following code produce an error? Why or why not? 
What output does this code send to the console?

for (let i = 0; i < 5;) {
  console.log(i += 1);
}

ANSWER:
No error. The code will not produce an error because the arguments
in the for loop are optional. No increment operation was specified in 
the increment component, but i was incremented in the console.log() statement.
