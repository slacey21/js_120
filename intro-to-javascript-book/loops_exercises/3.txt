3. The following code causes an infinite loop (a loop that never stops iterating). Why?

let counter = 0;

while (counter = 1) {
  console.log(counter);
  counter += 1;

  if (counter > 2) {
    break;
  }
}

ANSWER:
The conditional expression in the while loop uses '='
which is the assignment operator, not an equality operator.
So the return value of assigning the variable 'counter' to the value 1
returns 1 each time the expression is evaluated. the return value of 
'counter = 1' is 1 which is truthy, so the loop condition is never false.
Additionally, the code inside the loop increments counter by 1, but every loop
iteration, we are assigning counter to 1, so counter will never be > 2
this the if conditional is never true and the break statement is never
executed.
