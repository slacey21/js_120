// If we have a Car class and a Truck class, how can you use the Speed
// object as a mix-in to make them goFast? How can you check whether your
// Car or Truck can now go fast?

const Speed = {
  goFast() {
    console.log(`I'm a ${this.constructor.name} and going super fast!`);
  }
};

class Car {
  goSlow() {
    console.log(`I'm safe and driving slow.`);
  }
}

class Truck {
  goVerySlow() {
    console.log(`I'm a heavy truck and like going very slow.`);
  }
}

// Answer
Object.assign(Car.prototype, Speed)
Object.assign(Truck.prototype, Speed)

let blueTruck = new Truck();
blueTruck.goFast(); // => logs "I'm a Truck and going super fast!"

let smallCar = new Car();
smallCar.goFast(); // => logs "I'm a Car and going super fast!"
