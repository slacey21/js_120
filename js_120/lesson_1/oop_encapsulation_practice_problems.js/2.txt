Describe some advantages and disadvantages of OOP.

Some advantages are that OOP generally leads to better readability in 
very large programs and can allow the programmer to simplify the concepts
they are working with.

Some disadvantages are that sometimes programs get longer and require more memory and
do not always simplify a program.
