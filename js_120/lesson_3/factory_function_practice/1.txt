What are two disadvantages of working with factory functions?

1. Each object created with a factory function has a copy of all the same methods
which can be redundant and a poor use of memory for your program.

2. Objects created with a factory function have no indication that they were
created with a factory function, so there is no real way to tell the "type"
of the object.
